typically dp has two approachess

1. Top Down Approach (Memoization)
- In this approach, we start solving the problem from the top (the original problem) and
    break it down into smaller subproblems recursively.
- We store the results of these subproblems in a data structure (like an array or a hash map)

    to avoid redundant calculations.
- When we encounter the same subproblem again, we simply retrieve the stored result instead of
    recalculating it.
