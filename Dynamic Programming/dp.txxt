typically dp has two approachess

1. Top Down Approach (Memoization) --- we tend to store the results in memory
- In this approach, we start solving the problem from the top (the original problem) and
    break it down into smaller subproblems recursively.
- We store the results of these subproblems in a data structure (like an array or a hash map)

    to avoid redundant calculations.
- When we encounter the same subproblem again, we simply retrieve the stored result instead of
    recalculating it.


2. Bottom Up Approach (Tabulation)  
- In this approach, we solve the problem by first solving all the smaller subproblems and storing their results.
- We typically use an iterative approach and fill up a DP table (usually an array) based on the results of smaller subproblems.
- This approach often leads to more efficient space usage and avoids the overhead of recursive function calls.
