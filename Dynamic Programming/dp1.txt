//how to solve a dynamic programming problem 
typically dp has two approachess    
1. Top Down Approach (Memoization) --- we tend to store the results in memory
- In this approach, we start solving the problem from the top (the original problem) and
    break it down into smaller subproblems recursively.

2. Bottom Up Approach (Tabulation)  
- In this approach, we solve the problem by first solving all the smaller subproblems and storing their results.
- We typically use an iterative approach and fill up a DP table (usually an array) based


//the basic approach that starts with solving the problem of dp 
1.we tend to store the indexes of the problems that we have already solved
--like we tends to represent the problem in terms of indexes    
2.we do all possible choices at that index
3.we move to the next index and repeat the same process on the next index
4.we keep doing this until we reach the base case
