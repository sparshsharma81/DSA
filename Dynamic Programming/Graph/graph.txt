graph are connections of points 
graph is network of nodes 

each point in a graph is vertex 
and connection between two points is edge 

//Application of graph 
//graphs has lots of algorithms
1. shortest path algorithm



///Socail Networks


//Delivery network 

///like it is used in the shortest cyclic path 
//the way is divided in such a way that in minimum way..maximum paths are delivered 
///shortest cyclic path 

//there are different applications of graphs

vertex --- each node in graph ..
total number of vertexes in graph 

edges -- connection -- which connect two edges , two vertexes 

like some roads are on way ..
some roads are two directional 



directed graph --- graph has direction 

undirected graph -- the graph does not have any direction 

weight --- it is the weight of any edge in graph 
//like for the shortest path..we need to find the minimum weight in graph
