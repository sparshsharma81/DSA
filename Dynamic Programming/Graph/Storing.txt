storing a graph in code 

//we store in the form of class 


1.Most efficient -- Adjacency List
2.adjacency matrix 
3.edge list 
4.2d matrix 


adjacency list -- in this we make list of lists and store them in single list 

all the vertexess which we can directly reach..they are neighbours in terms of graph 
like graph has a size 


//we can store two information  --- source and destination 
 0 -> { 0, 2}
 1 -> {1,2} , {1,3}
 2 -> {2,0} , {2,1} , {2,3}
 3 -> {3,1} , {3,2} 

 these are list of lists 


 ArrayList<Edge>graph[v] 
 //like every edge has source and destination
  static class Edge{
    int src;
    int dst;
    
  }
